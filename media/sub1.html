            <h2>Background Story</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse tincidunt pellentesque lectus non accumsan. Sed tempus sapien et diam maximus cursus. Aliquam fringilla porttitor ligula non sagittis</p>
            <img src="./images/story_img1.png" alt="">
            <p class="text_in">A story comes down like a legend in Hiral. The content was that one day, the disaster will revive, and the Guardians are asleep under the ground to counter it. The prophecy said that the princess with holy power and the knight chosen by the sword that drives out the darkness could defeat Ganon by using the power of the Guardian.
                The kingdom of Hiral does not take this story lightly and searches the entire Hiral area in case of an emergency, leading to the excavation of ancient artifacts left by ancestors a long time ago. When Shinsu and the Guardian are excavated, immediately the kingdom of Hiral selects four people with special abilities and is tasked with controlling each Shinsu. They were called Younggeol, and Princess Zelda, the knight she nominated, and Younggeol are given the responsibility to seal Ganon.</p>
            <p class="text_in">Soon after, ancient researchers in the High Ral Kingdom succeeded in figuring out how to activate and manipulate the Guardian. Link had long been a master sod article, and young girls began to practice manipulation of new numbers. But there was only one problem, so Zelda failed to open up the power of the seal, even though she tried all kinds of methods. Zelda felt sorry that she was not helping everyone because she couldn't open up her power, so she searched everywhere with the Seeker Stone coming down from the royal family to find out the secret of Shinsu, but it wasn't enough.       
                As time goes by, Zelda celebrates her 17th birthday. Zelda will go to the fountain of wisdom, which has not been able to go so far, due to the rule that only wise people over the age of 17 can step in. Zelda prays from the spring of wisdom toward the goddess, but the power is not open, just as she prayed from the spring of courage and power.</p>
            <p class="text_in">As soon as he tries to return to Hial Province without earning any income, disaster Gannon breaks the long silence and resurrects. Younggeol takes his place in his respective position and waits to fight against Ganon. But something unexpected happens. Disaster Ganon contaminated the Guardian with evil and made it his side. In front of Yeonggeoldeul Field, Ganon's alter ego appears, depriving them of their special abilities and robbing Shinsu. Young girls had no choice but to be helpless because they had yet to fully learn how to control their status. This evil-colored Guardian began to destroy Hyral. 
                Meanwhile, Link, who couldn't save Hyral from Ganon, runs away with Zelda. Link takes the lead until the end to protect Zelda, but he is seriously injured in the process. A contaminated Guardian appears in front of the injured link. Link faces the Guardian with all his might to protect Zelda despite Zelda's dissuasion. The moment the Guardian tries to attack the link, Zelda blocks the link, and at this time, Zelda's power is opened.</p>
            <p class="text_in">Zelda, who removed the Guardian's evil mind with an unidentified force, is surprised by the identity of the power she did not know. Zelda leaves her surprised mind behind and cares for the fallen link, but eventually Link fails to overcome the injury and falls into a state of moribundity. At this time, however, the spirit in the master sod responds. Master Sword's spirit whispers Zelda not to let go of the string of hope yet, and Zelda sends a link to the rehabilitation shrine.
                After that, Zelda goes to the deck tree and asks them to protect the master sod until the link wakes up, and asks the master sod to wait for the link. Zelda puts the master sod deep in the castle in front of the deck tree and seals herself in Hiral Castle, where the disaster is located, to stop the resurrection of the paddy for a while.</p>
            <p class="text_in">Link, who healed the wound in the shrine of rehabilitation, wakes up in someone's voice from a long sleep of 100 years. However, in return for using the resurrection facility, Link had lost his memory. Link, who has no memory of the past, comes out of the strange room where he fell asleep and finds a huge meadow that was once the kingdom of Hiral. Link meets an old explorer who passes by and hears that 100 years ago, a great evil called disaster Gannon appeared, turning Hiral into ruins, and instead sealing him at Hiral Castle because he could not kill him.        
                Over the years, only the old traces of Hiral remained. However, even in sealed conditions, Ganon gradually developed his strength, and soon his power would destroy the seal.</p>
